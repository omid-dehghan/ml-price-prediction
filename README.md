# 📈 Results
The performance of each model was evaluated using standard regression metrics:

Model	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)	R² Score
Linear Regression	[NAN]	[NAN]
Random Forest	[NAN]	[NAN]
XGBoost	[NAN]	[NAN]

# 🔮 Future Work
Experiment with deep learning models (LSTM, GRU) for time-series forecasting.

Implement hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.

Develop a simple web interface for predictions using Flask or Streamlit.
